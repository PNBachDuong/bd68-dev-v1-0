# BD68 Dev v1.0

Portable agent pack for the BD68 and WildSoul workflow.

This repo is now organized as an IDE-agnostic pack:
- `core/` is the source of truth for the shared operating profile
- `references/` contains curated GitHub-backed retrieval sources and optional guidance files
- `adapters/` contains IDE-specific bootstrap files
- `scripts/` contains installers or helper scripts

## Current Status
- Implemented adapter: `OpenCode`
- Compatibility layer kept at repo root: `SKILL.md` and `agents/openai.yaml` for Codex skill usage
- Not claimed yet: full universal IDE support

## Structure
- `core/BD68_PROFILE.md`
- `references/SOURCE_INDEX.md`
- `references/impeccable.md`
- `references/concise-planning.md`
- `references/antigravity.md`
- `adapters/opencode/AGENTS.singlefile.template`
- `adapters/opencode/AGENTS.md.template`
- `adapters/opencode/MCP_SETUP.md`
- `scripts/install-agent-pack.ps1`
- `SKILL.md`
- `agents/openai.yaml`

## References
- `references/` is not just a notes folder.
- Each file in `references/` is a curated local reference with a specific use and upstream provenance.
- Open `references/SOURCE_INDEX.md` first to see what each local reference maps to on GitHub and when to use it.
- Prefer the local curated reference before re-browsing the upstream GitHub source when the local file already covers the task.

## Purpose
- keep retrieval order consistent with `memoryai`, `chub`, and `vfs`
- standardize context hygiene for long-running agent sessions
- keep the short GPT-5.4 token cost summary behavior available
- make the BD68 profile portable without requiring non-Codex IDEs to inspect `.codex`

## OpenCode Install
Install the OpenCode adapter on Windows:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install-agent-pack.ps1 -Target opencode
```

What it does:
- copies the shared profile from `core/`
- copies shared references from `references/`
- writes the OpenCode bootstrap from `adapters/opencode/`
- updates `C:\Users\<user>\.config\opencode\AGENTS.md` in single-file mode

After the command completes, open a new OpenCode session to load the profile.

## Codex Compatibility
If you want to use this repo as a Codex skill, the root compatibility files are still present:
- `SKILL.md`
- `agents/openai.yaml`

Those files are optional compatibility artifacts. They are no longer the conceptual center of the pack.
